### Motivation
Flicks is a web application that allows users to explore many movies and tv shows. Users can discover new movies and shows by navigating through or by searching title names. Additionally users can login through the movie database website which enables them to view their profile and add to their favourites or watchlists. I built this to first to learn and keep up to date with modern technologies and also to add to my portfolio.
